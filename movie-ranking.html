    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>How to train your dragon</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite cartoon. This animated film is beautiful to watch, but that is not the main drawing point. The drawing point are the characters. Even though this is set in some fictitious land full of Vikings beset with fire breathing dragons who are always raiding their livestock, you can easily relate to everybody.</p>
    <h3>Rush Hour</h3>
    <p>Really Funny, action  movie.</p>
    <h3>Man of Steel</h3>
    <p>A good movie .</p>, initial-scale=1.0">
